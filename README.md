This project aims to design using MATLAB, a simple planning tool for a service provider that
owns 340 channels in the 900 MHz band. The code asks for the GOS (Grade os service), city area,
user density, SIRmin and sectorization method. The blocked calls are cleared in this
system. Then, it produces the following design parameters:
1) Cluster Size.
2) Number of cells.
3) Cell radius.
4) Traffic intensity per cell, and traffic intensity per sector.
5) Base station transmitted power.
6) A plot for the MS (Mobile station) received power in dBm versus the receiver distance from the BS (Base Station).
In your design, use the Hata model and assume urban-medium city .The effective heights of BS and MS equal 20 and 1.5 meters,
respectively. Assume MS sensitivity equals âˆ’95 dBm, the traffic intensity per user equals
0.025 Erlang and the path loss exponent equals 4.
This Project also includes various test cases to ensure that the code is working.
